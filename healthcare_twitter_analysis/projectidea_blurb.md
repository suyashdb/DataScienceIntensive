Plan is to get twitter data for some set of diseases from three years 2014-2015. 

Few questions which i would like to answer will be:
1) To find trend of diseases in a particular geographical area over the years.
2) Correlate twitter data with CDC data for 1-2 disease? Does the trending dieseases tags affect people pyschologically to say even they are affected by 
by those particular disease even though they CDC shows some other disease spread around too. 



Status:

Looks like the twitter data which i was aming to dig into is corrpted and not in a proper format as expected. I contacted the person to share data again which was an futile effort.
